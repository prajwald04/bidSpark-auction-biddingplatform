# Current Milestone Goal:
This is the 1st milestone, its goal is:
- upgrade `Java` to *21*


# Next steps:
1. You **MUST!** identify all the dependencies or code that need upgrading to upgrade `Java` to *21*, and make all necessary changes with any tools you prefer.
    - Here is some knowledge that you may leverage during the upgrade:
        - Apply OpenRewrite recipe `org.openrewrite.java.migrate.UpgradeToJava21` in recipe lib `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:2.31.1` to make initial code changes for upgrading Java project to Java 21 from any previous version larger than Java 8.
    
2. You **MUST!** remember to invoke tool #build_java_project with sessionId "20260108154040" to validate the changes after performing the upgrade as any code change might introduce new build errors.

# Important Notes:
- You **MUST** fetch the contents first if guidelines are provided as links.
- You **MUST** ONLY upgrade the dependencies that are incompatible with the target version of Java/dependencies.
- You **MUST** ONLY make all necessary code changes to achieve the current milestone goal without any deviation whatsoever.
- You **MUST** strictly adhere to the current milestone goal but not the final upgrade goal.
- You **MUST** invoke tool #build_java_project to validate the changes regardless of how confident you are in your code changes. Even if:
    - You've already built the project before
    - You believe no new build errors could have been introduced
    - Previous checks showed no build errors
- You **MUST** maintain the exact same functionality/behavior logic when making any code changes. You **MUST NOT** change the original code functionality/behavior when making any code changes.
- "Guidelines" has higher priority than "Knowledge", so when there is any conflict between them, you **MUST** follow the guidelines.
- OpenRewrite recipes are preferable for upgrading dependencies and making code changes if applicable and provided as knowledge/guidelines.
    - You **MUST** use the JDK at "C:\Users\DELL\.jdk\jdk-8\bin" and the Maven at "C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\apache-maven-3.9.9-bin\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin" to apply OpenRewrite recipes, so be careful about the environment configuration before running terminal command to apply OpenRewrite recipes.
    - You should use `org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:5.47.3` (for Maven) or `org.openrewrite:plugin:6.28.3` (for Gradle) to apply OpenRewrite recipes if user didn't specify any version in the guidelines.
    - You **MUST** add "--quiet" parameter to the maven or gradle command when applying OpenRewrite recipes to avoid unnecessary output logs, the recipes are applied successfully as long as there is no error reported in the output.
    - You'd better use OpenRewrite YAML file (`rewrite.yml`) to configure all the necessary recipes to be applied, which then be referenced as active recipe by the `name` defined in the rewrite.yml when being applied. Remember to place the yaml file at the project root directory.
    - You **MUST** revert the OpenRewrite related configuration changes you made after applying the recipes to avoid polluting the project.

The upgrade plan at C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\bidspark\e-auction-platform\backend-eauction\.github\java-upgrade\20260108154040\plan.md has been updated and confirmed.

# Confirmed final upgrade goal:
- upgrade `Java` to *21*



Now, let's start with the first milestone goal of upgrading the project.


# Current Milestone Goal:
This is the 1st milestone, its goal is:
- upgrade `Java` to *21*


# Next steps:
1. You **MUST!** identify all the dependencies or code that need upgrading to upgrade `Java` to *21*, and make all necessary changes with any tools you prefer.
    - Here is some knowledge that you may leverage during the upgrade:
        - Apply OpenRewrite recipe `org.openrewrite.java.migrate.UpgradeToJava21` in recipe lib `org.openrewrite.recipe:rewrite-migrate-java:2.31.1` to make initial code changes for upgrading Java project to Java 21 from any previous version larger than Java 8.
    
2. You **MUST!** remember to invoke tool #build_java_project with sessionId "20260108154040" to validate the changes after performing the upgrade as any code change might introduce new build errors.

# Important Notes:
- You **MUST** fetch the contents first if guidelines are provided as links.
- You **MUST** ONLY upgrade the dependencies that are incompatible with the target version of Java/dependencies.
- You **MUST** ONLY make all necessary code changes to achieve the current milestone goal without any deviation whatsoever.
- You **MUST** strictly adhere to the current milestone goal but not the final upgrade goal.
- You **MUST** invoke tool #build_java_project to validate the changes regardless of how confident you are in your code changes. Even if:
    - You've already built the project before
    - You believe no new build errors could have been introduced
    - Previous checks showed no build errors
- You **MUST** maintain the exact same functionality/behavior logic when making any code changes. You **MUST NOT** change the original code functionality/behavior when making any code changes.
- "Guidelines" has higher priority than "Knowledge", so when there is any conflict between them, you **MUST** follow the guidelines.
- OpenRewrite recipes are preferable for upgrading dependencies and making code changes if applicable and provided as knowledge/guidelines.
    - You **MUST** use the JDK at "C:\Users\DELL\.jdk\jdk-8\bin" and the Maven at "C:\Users\DELL\Downloads\apache-maven-3.9.9-bin\apache-maven-3.9.9\bin" to apply OpenRewrite recipes, so be careful about the environment configuration before running terminal command to apply OpenRewrite recipes.
    - You should use `org.openrewrite.maven:rewrite-maven-plugin:5.47.3` (for Maven) or `org.openrewrite:plugin:6.28.3` (for Gradle) to apply OpenRewrite recipes if user didn't specify any version in the guidelines.
    - You **MUST** add "--quiet" parameter to the maven or gradle command when applying OpenRewrite recipes to avoid unnecessary output logs, the recipes are applied successfully as long as there is no error reported in the output.
    - You'd better use OpenRewrite YAML file (`rewrite.yml`) to configure all the necessary recipes to be applied, which then be referenced as active recipe by the `name` defined in the rewrite.yml when being applied. Remember to place the yaml file at the project root directory.
    - You **MUST** revert the OpenRewrite related configuration changes you made after applying the recipes to avoid polluting the project.


> [!NOTE]
* You MUST follow the above "Next steps" instructions.
* You have the highest decision-making authority at any time, you do NOT need to seek my approval/confirmation, please directly execute your plan as you see fit.
